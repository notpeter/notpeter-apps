# USPS Forever Rates Mini-App

## Future TODO

- [Why Is “Forever” Crossed Out on Postage Stamp Images?](https://www.stampsforever.com/resources/why-is-forever-crossed-out-on-postage-stamps)
- Why are certain stamps/products missing?
  - We are not attempting to be a comprehensive guide to all stamps that have ever been published.
  - The primary purpose of this site is to find postage for usage; not postage fort collecting.
  - Stamps/products which are not purchasable by the public (Pre-sorted stamps, etc) are intentionally excluded
  - Commemerative formats (framed stamp, first day of issue card, etc) are intentionally excluded.
