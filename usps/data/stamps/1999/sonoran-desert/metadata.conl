  The *Sonoran Desert* stamp pane of 10 designs is the first in a series of educational stamp panes issued to promote appreciation of the North American biomes. The scene is a creation of the artist's imagination, but each element is painted accurately, based on photo reference and on research by Professor David E. Brown, a specialist in the classification of biotic communities. A list of the common and Latin names of each plant and animal in the stamp art appear on the back of the stamp sheet.
