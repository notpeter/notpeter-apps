  The *Alpine Tundra* stamp pane is the ninth in an educational series designed to promote appreciation of major plant and animal communities in the United States.

  To illustrate the diversity of species associated with alpine tundra, artist John D. Dawson depicted more than 24 animal and plant species in his beautiful acrylic painting. The scene itself is imaginary: Such a dense grouping of plants and animals was necessary to illustrate as many species as possible on the stamp pane. Even so, all of the species could be encountered on the alpine tundra of Rocky Mountain National Park; all were recommended by scientists.
