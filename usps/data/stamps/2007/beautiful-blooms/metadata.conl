  In 2007 the U.S. Postal Service returned to a flower theme with the issuance of 10 *Beautiful Blooms* definitive stamps. Photographs of nine different flowers appear on these stamps. Many of these flowers are found in gardens: the coneflower, dahlia, chrysanthemum, gerbera daisy, tulip, and iris. Others, for example, the poppy, are often seen in masses along major highways. The water lily, of course, needs a pond as a home, while the magnolia bloom graces the tall and elegant tree. Noted photographer Mark Laita created the photographs used on the stamps.
