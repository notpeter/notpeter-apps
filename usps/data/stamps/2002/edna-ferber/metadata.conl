about = With this fourth issuance in the Distinguished Americans series, the U.S. Postal Service honors Pulitzer Prize-winning author Edna Ferber. Artist Mark Summers — well known for his scratchboard technique — created this portrait for the stamp using as a reference a black-and-white photograph of Ferber taken in 1927. Mark Summers also created the stamp art for the first three issuances in the Distinguished Americans series: Joseph W. Stilwell (2000), Claude Pepper (2000), and Hattie W. Caraway (2001).
