  With this fourth issuance in the *Distinguished Americans* series, the U.S. Postal Service honors Pulitzer Prize-winning author Edna Ferber.

  Artist Mark Summers — well known for his scratchboard technique — created this portrait for the stamp using as a reference a black-and-white photograph of Ferber taken in 1927.

  Mark Summers also created the stamp art for the first three issuances in the *Distinguished Americans* series: *Joseph W. Stilwell* (2000), *Claude Pepper* (2000), and *Hattie W. Caraway* (2001).
