about = With this fifth issuance in the Distinguished Americans series, the U.S. Postal Service honors Wilma Rudolph, who overcame a childhood plagued by serious illness to become one of the nation’s greatest athletes. Artist Mark Summers — well known for his scratchboard technique — created this portrait for the stamp using as a reference a photograph of Rudolph taken after she won three gold medals at the 1960 Olympic Games in Rome. Summers also created the stamp art for the first four issuances in the Distinguished Americans series: Joseph W. Stilwell (2000), Claude Pepper (2000), Hattie W. Caraway (2001), and Edna Ferber (2002).
