  In anticipatory celebration of the September 2004 opening of the National Museum of the American Indian on the Mall in Washington, D.C., the U.S. Postal Service issued a pane of 10 stamps entitled Art of the American Indian.

  These 10 stamps offer a sampling of the diverse ways in which American Indians, in the context of their everyday lives, created utilitarian, social, spiritual, or commercial objects that were also extraordinary expressions of beauty. Descriptive text on the back includes an overview and specific information about each of the ten objects.
