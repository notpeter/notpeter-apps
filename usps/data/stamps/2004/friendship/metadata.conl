  With help from some of Walt Disney’s famous animated characters, four stamps illustrate the theme of friendship. USPS art director Terrence McCaffrey joined with a Disney team including artist Peter Emmerich to represent four distinct types of friendship: Mickey Mouse, Goofy, and Donald Duck are the perfect fun-loving group; Pinocchio and Jiminy Cricket exemplify a mentoring relationship; Bambi and Thumper represent childhood best friends; and Mufasa and Simba show the powerful bond between parent and child.
