  Kwanzaa is a non-religious African-American holiday that takes place over seven days from December 26 to January 1. Art director Derry Noyes and stamp artist Daniel Minter strove to create a design that appropriately balances formality with a celebratory, festive mood. The seven days of Kwanzaa, and the seven principles they signify, are represented by seven figures.

  Minter created his illustration from a linoleum block print and then added vibrant, carefully chosen colors using computer software. "I wanted to incorporate the colors of the pan-African flag: black, red, and green," he explains. "To bring a more festive flavor to the image, I added the colors gold, yellow, and blue to the robes."
