about = The U.S. Postal Service celebrates four beloved animals with the issuance of Winter Woodland Animals . Each stamp features a whimsical, graphic image of one of four different woodland animals: a deer, fox, rabbit, and owl. The animals appear with details of their habitat in winter such as a full or crescent moon, snow-covered trees, holly branches with berries, and delicate snowflakes. The illustrations were created digitally. White-tailed deer are one of the most plentiful species of deer in North America. On crisp autumn days, woodland bucks use their lofty antlers to establish dominance over other males competing for female attention. The advent of winter and the end of the mating season bring new priorities — finding food and conserving energy until spring returns anew. Admired for their classic beauty and agility, woodland deer grace everything from holiday cards to warm woolen sweaters in celebration of the winter season. The resilient and adaptable fox has learned to survive and flourish in almost every environment in the world including deserts and arctic tundra. To protect themselves from winter’s bitter cold, foxes use their thick, shaggy tails much like a fluffy scarf to cover their noses and feet. Woodland rabbits often live near the forest’s edge so that they can easily find food from gardens, yards, and meadows. This habitat provides good protection from predators as well as ample vegetation for these hungry herbivores. When winter comes, woodland rabbits forage for tree bark and woody plants while waiting out the winter chill in cozy hollows built with grass, fur, and twigs. Dense conifers are ideal places for woodland owls to roost. They rarely build their own nests, preferring to make use of natural tree hollows or abandoned nests built by other birds. In winter, these fascinating birds of prey can be easier to spot due to darker days and less tree foliage. Art director Antonio Alcalá designed the stamps with Katie Kirk who illustrated the stamps. The Winter Woodland Animals stamps are being issued as Forever® stamps. These Forever stamps are always equal in value to the current First-Class Mail® one-ounce price.
