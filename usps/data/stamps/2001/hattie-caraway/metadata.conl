about = With this third issuance in the Distinguished Americans series, the U.S. Postal Service honors Hattie Wyatt Caraway (1878–1950), the first woman elected to the U.S. Senate. Artist Mark Summers — well-known for his scratchboard technique — created this portrait for the stamp using as reference a black-and-white photograph of Senator Caraway taken on October 21, 1943. Mark Summers also created the stamp art for the first two issuances in the Distinguished Americans series — Joseph W. Stilwell (2000) and Claude Pepper (2000).
