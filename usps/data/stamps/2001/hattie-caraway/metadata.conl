  With this third issuance in the *Distinguished Americans* series, the U.S. Postal Service honors Hattie Wyatt Caraway (1878–1950), the first woman elected to the U.S. Senate.

  Artist Mark Summers — well-known for his scratchboard technique — created this portrait for the stamp using as reference a black-and-white photograph of Senator Caraway taken on October 21, 1943.

  Mark Summers also created the stamp art for the first two issuances in the *Distinguished Americans* series — *Joseph W. Stilwell* (2000) and *Claude Pepper* (2000).
