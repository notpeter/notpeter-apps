  *$5 Floral Geometry*, an elegant stamp from the U.S. Postal Service, will lend a contemporary appearance to packages, large envelopes, and other mailings. The $5 stamp is one of two similarly designed high-denomination stamps issued in 2022. The other stamp is denominated at $2.

  The stamp art features a series of overlapping geometric shapes, including circles, ovals, and triangles, that reflect the symmetry of floral patterns found in nature in their simplest forms. As the stamp denominations rise, the designs become more complex. The watercolor backgrounds were painted by hand and scanned; the white geometric lines and typography were added digitally. The background for the $5 stamp is purple. The stamps were printed with a foil treatment that adds a stylish glimmer to the design.

  Antonio Alcalá was the art director. The stamps were designed and created by the firm Spaeth Hill.

  The *$5 Floral Geometry* stamp is issued in panes of 4 stamps.
