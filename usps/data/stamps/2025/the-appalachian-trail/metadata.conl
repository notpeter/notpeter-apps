about = The Appalachian National Scenic Trail traverses almost 2,200 miles along one of Earth’s most ancient mountain ranges, yet is within easy reach of large metropolitan areas of the East Coast. The U.S. Postal Service celebrates the Appalachian Trail (A.T.) with a pane of 15 photographic stamps showcasing the scenic variety found along this century-old footpath. Each stamp except for the first is labeled with the name of the pictured state and “USA.” Printed in white capitals, vertically up the left side of each photograph, is the title “APPALACHIAN TRAIL,” with undulations evoking the zigs and zags of the Maine-to-Georgia trail itself. The word “FOREVER,” appears twice on each stamp, sandwiching the title. The first stamp — which at its top right is labeled simply “USA” — represents A.T. segments through dense forest, which hikers call “the green tunnel.” (photograph by Nico Schueler). Additional first-row stamps are MAINE (photo by Justin Birt) and TENNESSEE (photo by Kevin Rohn). Second row: NEW HAMPSHIRE (photo by Jessica Rodriguez); GEORGIA (photo by Sandra Burm); VERMONT (photo by Drew Housten). Third row: PENNSYLVANIA (photo by Bart Smith); MARYLAND (photo by Ryan Tasto); WEST VIRGINIA (photo by Ed Heaton). Fourth row: NORTH CAROLINA (photo by Dave Allen); NEW YORK (photo by Angelo Marcialis); MASSACHUSETTS (photo by Jenna Foster). Fifth row: VIRGINIA (photo by Brent McGuirt); NEW JERSEY (photo by Drew Housten); CONNECTICUT (photo by Hanit Mizrachi Avondoglio). Each year several million people set foot on the Appalachian Trail to make the most of its peace and beauty, and to take a break from the stresses of modern life. Art director Antonio Alcalá designed the pane using existing photographs. The Appalachian Trail stamps are being issued as Forever® stamps. Forever stamps are always equal in value to the current First-Class Mail® one-ounce price.
