about = In 2008 the U.S. Postal Service issued a pane of 16 stamps to honor designers Charles and Ray Eames. Perhaps best known for their furniture, the Eameses were husband and wife as well as design partners. Their extraordinary body of creative work — which reflected the nation's youthful and inventive outlook after World War II — also included architecture, films, exhibits, textiles, toys, graphics, sculpture, and more. Without abandoning tradition, Charles and Ray Eames used new materials and technology to create high-quality products that addressed everyday problems and made modern design available to the American public.
