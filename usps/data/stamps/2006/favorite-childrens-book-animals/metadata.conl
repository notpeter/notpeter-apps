about = In 2006 the U.S. Postal Service honored eight cherished animal characters from children's literature with the Favorite Children's Book Animals stamp pane. Children and adults alike will delight in these lively and colorful stamps, two of which — The Very Hungry Caterpillar and Maisy — were also issued by Royal Mail in the United Kingdom.
