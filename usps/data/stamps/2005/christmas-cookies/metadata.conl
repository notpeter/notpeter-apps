about = In 2005 the U.S. Postal Service celebrated the winter holiday season with four stamps featuring festively decorated cookies. Photographer Sally Andersen-Bruce of New Milford, Connecticut, recruited a team of experts — including Tommy Simpson, of Washington, Connecticut (who also made the cookie cutters); Emily Diffrient-Crumpton, of Austin, Texas; and Rebecca Vermilyea, of Bethlehem, Connecticut — to help bake and decorate the charming cookies shown on these stamps.
