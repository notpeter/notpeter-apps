  With this stamp pane, the U.S. Postal Service salutes 12 masterworks of modern American architecture. Art director Derry Noyes and designer Margaret Bauer chose breathtaking photographs to honor each building. The picture of the Walt Disney Concert Hall is by Todd Eberle. Guido Guidi photographed the twin apartment towers at 860-880 Lake Shore Drive in Chicago. The classic image of the Chrysler Building was made by Margaret Bourke-White. The Vanna Venturi House was photographed by Matt Wargo. The East Building of the National Gallery of Art is shown in an image made by Ben Spiegel. Grant Mudford took the photograph of the Exeter Academy Library and Georg Fischer photographed the TWA Terminal. The remaining five photographs — of the Guggenheim Museum, the Yale Art and Architecture Building, the High Museum of Art, the Glass House, and the Hancock Center — are by Ezra Stoller.
