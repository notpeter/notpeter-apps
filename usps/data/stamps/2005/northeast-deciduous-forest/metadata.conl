  The *Northeast Deciduous Forest* stamp pane is the seventh in an educational series designed to promote appreciation of major plant and animal communities in the United States.

  Featured on the stamp pane is a painting by artist John D. Dawson. Although the scene itself is imaginary, all of the species depicted can be found in deciduous forests of the Northeast.

  A description of this type of forest community and a numbered key to the artwork appear on the back of the pane, along with a corresponding list of common and scientific names for 27 selected species.
