about = With help from some of Walt Disney’s famous animated characters, four stamps illustrate the theme of celebration. USPS art director Terrence McCaffrey joined with a Disney team including artist Peter Emmerich and creative director Dave Pacheco to represent four fun-loving groups who know how to have a good time: Mickey Mouse and Pluto are experts when it comes to sharing cake; the Mad Hatter and Alice throw an uproarious party; mermaid Ariel and her undersea friends turn up the music; and Snow White and Dopey dance.
