  In celebration of the abstract expressionist artists of the 20th century, art director Ethel Kessler and noted art historian Jonathan Fineberg (Gutgsell Professor of Art History, University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign) selected 10 paintings to feature on this colorful pane of self-adhesive stamps. Kessler used elements from Barnett Newman’s *Achilles* (1952) to frame the stamps. The arrangement of the stamps suggests paintings hanging on a gallery wall. For design purposes the sizes of the stamps are not in relative proportion to the paintings. The pane also features selvage text and a quotation by Robert Motherwell.
