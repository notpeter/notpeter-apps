  These stamps, like the others in this series, were created as a continuous se-tenant, so they look to be growing in the same garden. The flowers — crocus, winter aconite, pansy, snowdrop, and anemone — were chosen because they bloom in the winter somewhere in the U.S.

  All the stamps in this series were designed by Ned Seidler. He created a single watercolor painting of the garden scene, which was used for the five-stamp set.
