about = Family violence is a national concern; its effects are felt regardless of age, race, or economic status. This semipostal has the distinction of featuring the work of a young artist who was originally intended to be the model in a photograph. When art director Carl T. Herrman and photographer Philip Channing saw a chalk drawing by Monique Blais, made during a break in their session, they realized there could be no better way to express the pain and sadness caused by domestic violence than to use artwork by a child. The final art is Monique’s drawing, at Herrman’s suggestion, of a "sad Mommy."
