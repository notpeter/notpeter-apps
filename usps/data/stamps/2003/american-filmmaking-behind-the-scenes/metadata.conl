about = In 2003, to coincide with the 75th anniversary celebration of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences, the U.S. Postal Service issued American Filmmaking: Behind the Scenes . This pane of 10 stamps honors American filmmakers — all of those multitalented, highly skilled men and women who work behind the scenes to create movie magic. As can be seen in the long list of credits trailing every motion picture, filmmaking is a uniquely collaborative endeavor, requiring the vision, expertise, and best efforts of scores of artists and craftspeople.
