  This presorted first-class coil stamp features an artistic rendering by Tom Engeman of a detail of the Great Seal of the United States. The stamp design includes the head and outstretched right wing of the American bald eagle, a portion of the shield on its breast, and the tip of the olive branch held in its right talon.

  The coil includes 10 stamps based on the original eagle design. In each version the eagle — in gold, green, blue, red, or gray — appears against a background of a contrasting color.
