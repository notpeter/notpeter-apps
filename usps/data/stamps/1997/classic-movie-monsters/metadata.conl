  The *Classic Movie Monsters* stamps represent a fortunate coincidence. At the same time the Postal Service began to develop the idea, the adult children of three classic movie-monster actors began campaigning to commemorate their fathers on stamps. The two paths converged, resulting in five of the creepiest — and most popular — stamps of the 1990s.
