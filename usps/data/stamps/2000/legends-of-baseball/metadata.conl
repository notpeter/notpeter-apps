  With the issuance of this *Classic Collection* stamp pane, the U.S. Postal Service, in partnership with Major League Baseball, honored 20 legendary baseball stars. Taken from Major League Baseball’s 100 nominees for the All-Century Team, they occupy a unique and important place in the history of our national pastime. Ten players appearing on this pane went on to become members of the All-Century Team: Ty Cobb, Lou Gehrig, Lefty Grove, Rogers Hornsby, Walter Johnson, Christy Mathewson, Jackie Robinson, Babe Ruth, Honus Wagner, and Cy Young.

  All of the individuals pictured on the stamp pane are members of the Baseball Hall of Fame. Two Negro Leagues greats are included: Josh Gibson and Satchel Paige, who had a brief Major League Baseball career. Also appearing on the stamp pane are Roberto Clemente, Mickey Cochrane, Eddie Collins, Dizzy Dean, Jimmie Foxx, George Sisler, Tris Speaker, and Pie Traynor. Four of the players — Jackie Robinson (1982, CTC 1940s), Babe Ruth (1983, CTC 1920s), Roberto Clemente (1984), and Lou Gehrig (1989) — have appeared on previous postage stamps.
