  The *Pacific Coast Rain Forest* stamp pane is the second in an educational series featuring the beauty and complexity of plant and animal communities in North America. *Sonoran Desert* was the first issuance in the series, which is entitled *Nature of America*.

  The Pacific coast rain forest is one of the largest remaining temperate rain forests in the world. Text describing this ecosystem and a list of the common and scientific names of the plants and animals included in the stamp art are found on the back of the stamp pane.
